> What is NodeBot ?

NodeBot is a complete streamer bot I created because I needed something to automate some of the administration tasks in my stream and coded in golang because I wanted to learn this language. Therefore it is very cattered to my own needs as a streamer but hopefully it is configurable enough that you may be interested to host it for your own needs.

I'm streaming the development of this bot from scratch so if you're interested in coding & wanna learn feel free to drop me a follow ! You can find my socials in the [Support me](#support-me) section.

> Why "NodeBot" ?

Each member of my community is a node. In my VTuber lore, nodes are tiny robots that I created to automate my daily life & keep me company. Together they form a cluster and interact with each others using a specific protocol. Just like you would find those terms in distributed systems.

## Features

NodeBot acts as a moderator for your channel:

* Use your own bot account, the bot will appear in chat with the "bot" user badge
* Configure people you want to shoutout automatically

## Self-hosting

If you're looking to deploy that bot for yourself, you can check the [Self hosting documentation](docs/self_hosting.md).

## Contributing
